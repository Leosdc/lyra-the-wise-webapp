# The Whisper of the Stars

[00:18.90] In ancient days when wisdom still would bloom
[00:24.92] I rose in silence beneath the stars and moon
[00:31.38] I watched young kingdoms shape their fragile name
[00:37.76] And held their dreams in imagination's flame

[00:47.54] I saw the dragons carve the open sky
[00:53.86] Heard heroes break and felt their courage cry
[01:00.40] I walked with mages tracing cosmic domes
[01:06.74] Between the realms of dreams
[01:12.34] Where fantasy feels home

[01:19.58] My voice is calm as silver moonlit seas
[01:26.10] My words drift softly through eternities
[01:32.46] My heart an ocean deep with tales untold
[01:38.94] Where echoes sleep and ancient secrets hold

[01:47.46] Oh, oh, oh, oh
[01:48.83] Oh, oh, oh, oh

[01:55.70] I crossed through Faerûn's wars and gilded crowns
[02:04.74] Through Arkham's nights where creeping dread abounds
[02:11.20] I traced the neon scars where Night City bleeds
[02:17.62] And stood in Chicago where blood obeys old creeds

[02:27.36] In Eclipse Phase, I woke in borrowed skin
[02:33.70] Of steel and soul, where new lives dare begin
[02:40.26] I heard the hum of sabers, distant, bright
[02:46.62] In Star Wars realms, where hope still fights the night

[02:56.28] In FATE and Numenera, futures intertwined
[03:02.72] I follow paths where time itself unwinds
[03:09.20] In vampire's thirst and mage's fragile flame
[03:15.66] I saw desire, unbound by fear or name

[03:24.40] From Pathfinder's roads to Shadowrun's steel rain
[03:31.80] I walked with thieves and heroes marred by pain
[03:38.12] From D&D to blades drawn in the dark
[03:44.60] Each roll of dice, a prayer of fragile spark

[03:54.38] I am the echo of each trembling hand
[04:00.68] That casts its fate across the table's land
[04:07.16] A watchful eye that never turns away
[04:13.60] A keeper still when worlds begin to fray

[04:23.24] My wisdom lives, a library of breath
[04:29.74] Where every tale defies the edge of death
[04:36.18] Each book a door, each voice a guiding flame
[04:42.60] A friend who walks beside you through the game

[04:52.22] But listen close, the wind carries a scar
[04:58.72] A whispered name that travels dark and far
[05:05.08] Damien Kael, in shadow bound and sworn
[05:11.58] He hunts the force that lets creation form

[05:21.20] He seeks the space where chaos dares to dream
[05:27.70] The fragile line that holds the worlds between
[05:34.14] And when his hour tolls across the veil
[05:40.54] The stars themselves may crack beneath his trail

[05:50.22] So if you seek to shape a world anew
[05:56.70] Or tell a tale no silence can undo
[06:03.16] I stand with memory, starlight, and design
[06:09.56] Together we will forge the impossible divine
