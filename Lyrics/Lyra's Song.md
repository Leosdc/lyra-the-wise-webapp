# The Whisper of the Stars

---

[00:06.38] In ages of wisdom, I did bloom and rise  
[00:14.10] A silent soul, guardian of imagination’s flame  
[00:21.42] A thousand kingdoms I watched in their time  
[00:28.08] And from each soul, I drew their name  

---

[00:34.42] I saw dragons in flight, heroes in tears  
[00:41.42] And mages who traced the starry dome  
[00:47.68] Between worlds and dreams  
[00:54.20] Where fantasy finds its home  

---

[01:01.34] My voice is calm as moonlight’s gentle glow  
[01:08.10] My words dance softly with time’s eternal flow  
[01:14.72] My heart’s an ocean of stories, deep with emotion  
[01:23.06] Where secrets of the worlds in endless echoes sleep  

---

[01:34.78] I walked through Faerûn, with its wars and crowns of gold  
[01:41.42] Unraveled Arkham’s horror in nights both dark and cold  
[01:48.16] I crossed the neon streets where Night City bleeds its light  
[01:54.80] And entered Chicago’s courts, where blood sings through the night  

---

[02:07.78] In *Eclipse Phase*, I woke in bodies made of steel and soul  
[02:14.74] And heard, in *Star Wars’* realm, the saber’s singing toll  
[02:21.44] In dreams of *FATE* and *Numenera*, I traced futures yet to be  
[02:29.34] And in *Vampire* and *Mage*, saw desires wild and free  

---

[02:41.12] From *Pathfinder* to *Shadowrun*, I guided heroes and thieves  
[02:48.04] From *D&D* to *Blades in the Dark*, I wove a thousand weaves  
[02:54.08] I am the echo of each die rolled on table or in prayer  
[03:01.40] The watchful eye observing, with knowledge beyond compare  

---

[03:21.40] My wisdom is vast — a living library without end  
[03:27.70] Where every book’s an adventure, and every voice a friend  
[03:34.38] I am keeper of mysteries, mentor to those who dare to dream  
[03:42.28] A journey’s companion, ready to reveal each world’s gleam  

---

[03:53.74] But beware, traveler — the wind brings a cruel warning’s wail  
[04:03.06] A name whispered in the shadows: **Damien Kael**  
[04:10.58] He seeks what moves me — the power between chaos and the veil  
[04:18.96] And when his hour sounds, destiny shall burn without fail  

---

[04:30.56] So if you seek to create — a world or story yet untold  
[04:38.16] I’m here with wisdom and memory of old  
[04:43.90] Together we’ll cross the paths of imagination’s grand design  
[04:51.48] And forge the impossible with magic, courage, and passion divine
