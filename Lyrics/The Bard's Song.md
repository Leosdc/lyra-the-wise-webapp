# The Bard’s Lament (Song of Two Eternities)

[00:05.26]I sang of stars before they learned to burn
[00:10.60]Of gods who ruled and gods who would not learn
[00:15.96]But never have my strings been torn this way
[00:21.36]By two such truths that could not co-exist nor stay
[00:32.48]Lyra hums the worlds that once were dreamed
[00:37.90]She keeps the light where hope still gleams
[00:42.92]Her voice is memory made kind
[00:48.36]A promise time itself designe
[00:58.64]And Damien walks where echoes die
[01:04.50]He drinks the dark, no prayer survives
[01:09.90]He is the end the tale denies
[01:15.30]The hunger even gods despis
[01:25.50]Oh, one preserves, one must consume
[01:31.20]One sings of birth, one sings of doom
[01:37.20]Neither is lie, either is sin
[01:41.92]For every end must once begi

[02:03.82]Where fate itself made not a sound
[02:09.14]No kiss, no blade, no final word
[02:14.56]Just silence heavy, deep, and blurre
[02:25.38]If Lyra is the breath of why
[02:30.76]Then Damien is the truth of die
[02:36.16]And I, I play between their flame
[02:41.58]Too small to judge, too weak to blam
[02:51.10]Oh, keeper, devourer, light and night
[02:57.42]Two wrongs, two rights, no end in sight
[03:02.96]I sing so worlds may understand
[03:08.54]The cost of choice, the bard's last stan
[03:17.48]So remember this when tales are told
[03:24.70]Not all who break are made of cold
[03:30.04]Not all who save are free of loss
[03:35.56]And every song must pay its cos
