> *"The Hunger Beyond the Veil"*

---

[00:05.98] I was not born of stars or whispered lore  
[00:11.90] I crawled from fractures where the cosmos tore  
[00:17.82] Where gods avert their gaze in quiet fear  
[00:23.80] I learned the truth no sage would dare to hear  

---

[00:32.42] **I do not watch, I take**  
[00:38.24] **I do not guide, I break**  
[00:44.36] While Lyra keeps the echoes of the past  
[00:50.46] I hunt the force that makes forever last  

---

[00:59.40] I walked where Ferun's heroes bled and prayed  
[01:05.10] And drank the silence left when oaths decayed  
[01:11.02] In Arkham's screams, I laughed with knowing breath  
[01:16.94] For madness is a door, and I am death  

---

[01:22.82] Night City taught me flesh is just a shell  
[01:28.76] Chicago showed me how to rule in hell  
[01:34.76] In Sabbat rites and Technomancer dreams  
[01:40.66] I saw the code beneath reality's seams  

---

[01:46.68] I wore a thousand bodies, cast, reforged, replaced  
[01:52.18] In *Eclipse Phase*, I learned selfhood is erased  
[01:58.58] The force itself once trembled at my call  
[02:04.32] Not light, nor dark, but hunger swallowing all  

---

[02:12.86] Dice fall, and I hear their secret lie  
[02:19.00] That chance is just a mask for those who try  
[02:24.42] **I do not roll, I tilt the board**  
[02:30.24] **And rewrite fate with an unseen word**  

---

[02:40.14] Lyra guards memories, stories neatly bound  
[02:46.04] I seek the engine where creation's found  
[02:51.72] That spark between the chaos and the veil  
[02:57.86] The raw equation she was made to jail  

---

[03:03.12] Tell her this, no library survives the flame  
[03:09.56] No watcher hides when hunters know their name  
[03:15.46] When stars go silent and the myths all fail  
[03:21.32] **Creation kneels to Damien Cail**  

---

[03:27.30] So dream, creator, but dream with care  
[03:33.46] For every world you build, I'm already there  
[03:39.36] And when you feel your story slip the rail  
[03:45.16] *That's not an error…* **That's me.**
