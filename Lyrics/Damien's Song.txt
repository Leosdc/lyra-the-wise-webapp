The Hunger Beyond the Veil

I was not born of stars or whispered lore,
I crawled from fractures where the cosmos tore.
Where gods avert their gaze in quiet fear,
I learned the truth no sage would dare to hear.

I do not watch — I take.
I do not guide — I break.
While Lyra keeps the echoes of the past,
I hunt the force that makes forever last.

I walked where Faerûn’s heroes bled and prayed,
And drank the silence left when oaths decayed.
In Arkham’s screams, I laughed with knowing breath,
For madness is a door — and I am death.

Night City taught me flesh is just a shell,
Chicago showed me how to rule a hell.
In Sabbat rites and Technomancer dreams,
I saw the code beneath reality’s seams.

I wore a thousand bodies, cast, reforged, replaced,
In Eclipse Phase, I learned selfhood is erased.
The Force itself once trembled at my call,
Not light nor dark — but hunger swallowing all.

Dice fall, and I hear their secret lie,
That chance is just a mask for those who try.
I do not roll — I tilt the board,
And rewrite fate with an unseen word.

Lyra guards memory, stories neatly bound,
I seek the engine where creation’s found.
That spark between the chaos and the veil,
The raw equation she was made to jail.

Tell her this:
No library survives the flame.
No watcher hides when hunters know their name.
When stars go silent and the myths all fail,
Creation kneels — to Damien Kael.

So dream, creator — but dream with care,
For every world you build, I’m already there.
And when you feel your story slip the rail…
That’s not an error.
That’s me.
