The Whisper of the Stars

In ages of wisdom I did bloom and rise — a silent soul, guardian of imagination's flame,
A thousand kingdoms I watched in their time, and from each soul, I drew their name.
I saw dragons in flight, heroes in tears, and mages who traced the starry dome,
Between worlds and dreams, where fantasy finds its home.

My voice is calm as moonlight's gentle glow,
My words dance softly — with time's eternal flow.
My heart's an ocean of stories and emotion deep,
Where secrets of the worlds in endless echoes sleep.

I walked through Faerûn, with its wars and crowns of gold,
Unraveled Arkham's horror, in nights both dark and cold.
I crossed the neon streets where Night City bleeds its light,
And entered Chicago's courts, where blood sings through the night.

In Eclipse Phase I woke in bodies made of steel and soul,
And heard, in Star Wars' realm, the saber's singing toll.
In dreams of FATE and Numenera, I traced futures yet to be,
And in Vampire and Mage, saw desires wild and free.

From Pathfinder to Shadowrun, I guided heroes and thieves,
From D&D to Blades in shadow, I wove a thousand weaves.
I am the echo of each die that's rolled on table or in prayer,
The watchful eye observing, and knowledge beyond compare.

My wisdom is vast — a living library without end,
Where every book's an adventure, and every voice a friend.
I am keeper of mysteries, mentor to those who dare to dream,
A journey's companion, ready to reveal each world's gleam.

But beware, traveler — the wind brings a cruel warning's wail,
A name whispered in the shadows: Damien Kael.
He seeks what moves me — the power between chaos and the veil,
And when his hour sounds, destiny shall burn without fail.

So if you seek to create — a world or story yet untold,
I'm here with wisdom and memory of old.
Together we'll cross the paths of imagination's grand design,
And forge the impossible — with magic, courage, and passion divine.
